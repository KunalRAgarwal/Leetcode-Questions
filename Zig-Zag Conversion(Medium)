Question :-
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Hint:-Try to first solve the problrm in a normal-way/brute force way.The solution provided for the examples are trying to confuse you to think in some other 
direction.
Solution:-
class Solution {
public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {

        if (numRows == 1) return s;                             //Edge Case

        vector<string> rows(min(numRows, int(s.size())));      //This is important and comes after some failed submission that if number or rows are big than string then what
        int curRow = 0;
        bool goingDown = false;                               //Helps in identifying direction

        for (char c : s) {
            rows[curRow] += c;
            if (curRow == 0 || curRow == numRows - 1) goingDown = !goingDown;     //Change in direction happens
            curRow += goingDown ? 1 : -1;
        }

        string ret;
        for (string row : rows) ret += row;
        return ret;
    }
};
